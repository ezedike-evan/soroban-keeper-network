# keeper-sdk

A Rust client SDK for the [Soroban keeper registry contract](../contracts/keeper-registry).

## Who this is for

This crate targets **native applications and contract-to-contract calls**:
long-running keeper bots, backend services, and other Rust or Soroban code
that wants to register, claim, and execute keeper tasks without shelling out
to a CLI or embedding a JS runtime.

If you're building a browser dashboard or a Node.js service instead, use the
TypeScript SDK — it targets that environment and speaks the same contract.

## Installation

```toml
[dependencies]
keeper-sdk = { git = "https://github.com/soroban-tooling/soroban-keeper-network", package = "keeper-sdk" }
```

## What's here today

* [`network`](src/network.rs) — named presets (`Network::Testnet`,
  `Network::Futurenet`, `Network::Mainnet`) carrying the RPC URL and network
  passphrase for each Stellar network, plus `Network::Custom` for a
  self-hosted node or regional provider. These match the keeper-bot example's
  `NETWORK_CONFIG` exactly.
* [`retry`](src/retry.rs) — a configurable [`RetryPolicy`] for the transient
  RPC failures a client hits (timeouts, dropped connections, a simulation
  endpoint that's temporarily down), applied only around the RPC call itself.
  A decoded contract error (`KeeperError`, e.g. `NotTaskClaimer`) is never
  retried — the contract already ran and already rejected it, so retrying
  wastes a submission attempt that can never succeed. See the module docs for
  the full reasoning, ported from the keeper-bot example's `withRetry` /
  `isPermanentError`.

```rust
use keeper_sdk::{Network, RetryPolicy};
use std::time::Duration;

let network = Network::Testnet;
let policy = RetryPolicy {
    max_attempts: 5,
    base_delay: Duration::from_millis(250),
    ..RetryPolicy::default()
};

println!("{} @ {}", network.rpc_url(), network.network_passphrase());
```

* [`client::KeeperRegistryClient`](src/client.rs) — the network-facing client.
  It owns the simulate, sign, submit flow once (`read` / `write`) and every
  typed method (`get_task`, `get_fee_bps`, `is_paused`, `set_fee_bps`) is a
  thin wrapper over it. Contract types (`Task`, `TaskType`, `TaskStatus`) and
  errors (`KeeperError`, via `RegistryClientError::Contract`) are the
  `keeper_registry` types themselves. The RPC layer is the `RpcTransport`
  trait, because this crate bundles no HTTP client; implement it over your
  Soroban RPC node, or over an in-process `Env` as
  `tests/registry_client_tests.rs` does.

```rust,ignore
let client = KeeperRegistryClient::new(contract_id, rpc_url, passphrase, my_transport)
    .with_signer(signer);
let fee_bps = client.get_fee_bps().await?;
client.set_fee_bps(fee_bps + 50).await?;
```

Contract rejections (`RegistryClientError::Contract`) are never retried;
transport failures during simulation are retried per the `RetryPolicy`, and
submission is never retried, since a lost response may mean it already landed.

  registration semantics and limits, shared with the contract and the other
  SDKs.

  crate's client will decode.
